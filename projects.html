The people who are logged in will compete with each other to attain the highest score. The highest score will be on the leaderboard. This project will pull the score from google firebase and it will be compared to the current score, and if the current score greater than the score from google firebase, then only it will push the score to the leaderboard. So this process makes the highest score to be in google firebase, which will be pulled when the website loads and will be displayed.</td>
